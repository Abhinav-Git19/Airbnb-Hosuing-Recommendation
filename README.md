# Project Overview
The given project was done as part of  Data Mining course in my 4th Semester. The project entails the idea of exploring the dataset provided by Airbnb  [Airbnb Public Domain Dataset](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and drawing necessary  insight from it so that the purpose of good Housing Recommendation is served. Here instead of using the already available packages from ML from scikit in python we have developed and customized our own Priority based KNN algorithm from scratch. Details of the project is further explained in the **DM Project Report.pdf**

## File Overview
Hosing Recommedation is done for two cities: *Los Angeles* and *Seattle*. Each of them have following files:

 - [.csv]: These are data files contain the listing details of various houses
 - [.R]: The code in it was used for the exploratory data analysis as well as preprocessing
 - [.png]: Images for the analysis done
 - [.py]: These are driver files for getting the recommendation  based on a user query
There is a consolidated **work** folder in which we have *Demos.ipynb* file for checking out the little demo for this project
